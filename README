The task consists in building a basic web page powered by a RESTful API that allows the user to upload new images (either from their computer or by providing a source url), list the images that have been uploaded so far as well as allow analyzing any of the images uploaded.

## Comenzando 🚀
You must provide a README file that clearly documents the functionalities implemented; how the functionalities can be used. 

### Run the Code 👩‍💻
how to run the code 
Any extra documentation will be valued positively.
### List of Steps 👣
You must also document in general lines the list of steps you have followed in order to design/plan the development of the task.
Extra technologies can be used if required. If any of the required/predefined technologies are replaced by others in your solution a reasonable justification must be provided.
### ⚡️🏃🏻💨💨
This technical test required me to learn in a short period of time about **Docker**, as it was necessary to create two separate docker micro-services, one for the web page and one for the RESful API.
###🧠 😣  💪  💡
It was a challenging task as I had not yet had the opportunity to test my Frontend skills (HTML, CSS, and JS) acquired while doing **CFGS DAW** and my Backend skills (Flask and Python) that I had acquired through self-study.
###📚 🔎
I sought consultations, due to mental blocks, for functions or technologies I was not familiar with at the time of development, from the following resources:
•	StackOverFlow, ChatGPT -> for technical parts or functions I needed to learn to tackle the technical test.
•	Youtube -> for tutorials that helped me to refresh something I had learned or to reinforce my understanding of technical aspects."

•	Brave Browser Inspect -> Perfect to see the changes that any CSS property makes in our Frontend.
###🔮 🆕
Other functions that could have been added to the frontend include:
An specific button for the analyze function.
A Drag & Drop.
An erase button.
###Gratitud 🎁
Regardless of the outcome, it has been a continuous learning process. In which I have been able to discover with what I have struggled the most, what I need to improve, and ways to keep challenging myself to become a more effe
