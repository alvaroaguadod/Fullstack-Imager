# 📷 Fullstack Imager 📷
<pre>The task consists in building a basic web page powered by a RESTful API that allows the user to upload new images (either from their computer or by providing a source url), list the images that have been uploaded so far as well as allow analyzing any of the images uploaded.<br />

## OH NO! BAD NEWS... already 📰😞 
Within a maximum of **96h**, I couldn't complete the task.  

**Frontend ->** In the folder named frontendpa there is 3 docker files, one JSON file and two folders. First being the static, which contains the CSS, the image, and the JS). Second one templates with the HTML. 
- The *HTML* is not yet being completed as for the error messages is just placed an space for them with red typo, and the JS functions are not being placed on it (only a JS file named app.js with the user thumbnails thing which is something I used to test the white wannabe screen).    
- The *JS* is not even tested yet therefore functions are not known to be working. Most probably they need to be redone.

**Backend ->** The Backend is complete and functional, if requests are made through a programme such as Insomnia. I therefore added an export from that programme. All the required endpoints are functional. 
- The */upload_images* uploads a picture from url or from a file, also creates a thumbnail from the original picture to be shown beside its picture name.  
- The */list_images* gives us a JSON with (latin-1) as the thumbnail and the key property of name.
- The */analyse_images* gives us a JSON only with the information of the <image_id> image.

**Docker ->** I need to learn more about it. Even the two images have been created, I do believe they need to be connected each other.

### Run the Code 👩‍💻

**Frontend ->** I directly opened the HTML on the Brave Browser. You can see the layout on the first screenshot. 

**Backend ->** I used Insomnia to send the requests and test it.

**Docker ->** Not yet been launched, and the connection between the two images has not been made either.

### List of Steps 👣
Desing Thinking is a skill I will start working on for my next projects.
I drew the frontend to get an idea of what it should look like and how it could be displayed.

As the project progressed, the questions piled up. But the politeness to say good morning (even to myself) was not lacking.

### ⚡️🏃🏻💨💨
This technical test required me to learn in a short period of time about **Docker**, as it was necessary to create two separate docker micro-services, one for the web page and one for the RESful API.

### 🧠 😣  💪  💡
It was a challenging task as I had not yet had the opportunity to test my Frontend skills (HTML, CSS, and JS) acquired while doing **CFGS DAW** and my Backend skills (Flask and Python) that I had acquired through self-study. The current Bootcamp on Backend with Python its being developed with a Django focused.

### 📚 🔎
I sought consultations, due to mental blocks, for functions or technologies I was not familiar with at the time of development, from the following resources:
•	StackOverFlow, ChatGPT -> for technical parts or functions I needed to learn to tackle the technical test.
•	Youtube -> for tutorials that helped me to refresh something I had learned or to reinforce my understanding of technical aspects."

•	Brave Browser Inspect -> Perfect to see the changes that any CSS property makes in our Frontend.

### 🔮 🆕
Other functions that could have been added to the frontend include:
An specific button for the analyze function.
A Drag & Drop.
An erase button.

### Gratitud 🎁
Regardless of the outcome, it has been a continuous learning process. In which I have been able to discover with what I have struggled the most, what I need to improve, and ways to keep challenging myself to become a more effe
